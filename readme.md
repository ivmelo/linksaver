## LinkSaver [![SensioLabsInsight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/c793f5f3-6a8f-4735-bf09-45fced6e134a/big.png)](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/c793f5f3-6a8f-4735-bf09-45fced6e134a)

LinkSaver is a simple web application designed to store your favourite links. It uses laravel as a framework and it's light and fast. In most of the cases, you don't even have to give a title for your url, as it is done automatically for you.

It is just a weekend project and I am doing it for fun (and to have an organized way to store my links without needing to use a third party service).

It is still in early development, but it works like a charm. I'll be adding new features soon such as tags, social features and collections.
